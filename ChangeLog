2016-01-25 0.12.5
- Fixes:
  - Fix crash on 32-bit systems (issue #546)
  - Fix compilation on Slackware (issue #547)
  - Terminal color reset code moved to the same line to prevent interference with logging (issue #545)
- Enhancements:
  - Executor now sends click coordinates via environment variables (issue #544)

2016-01-24 0.12.5
- Fixes:
  - Fix rendering corruption triggered occasionally when the compositor is disabled (regression in 0.12.4)

2016-01-23 0.12.4
- Enhancements:
  - Support for NETWM viewports (as used by Compiz or Unity) (issue #94)
  - The default desktop font (Gtk/FontName from XSettings) is used when a font is not specified in the config file
  - When no fonts are specified in the config, tint2 picks up the default font of the desktop environment via XSettings
  - Tint2 is now able to dump a stack trace to stderr and ~/.tint2-crash.log in case of a crash.
    If the cmake flag ENABLE_BACKTRACE is set, stack traces are dumped on X11 I/O errors.
    If the cmake flag ENABLE_BACKTRACE_ON_SIGNAL is set, stack traces are dumped also on signals such as SIGSEGV.
    Both ENABLE_BACKTRACE and ENABLE_BACKTRACE_ON_SIGNAL are disabled by default.
  - Pixmaps are cached instead of always redrawn between different button states when mouse effects are enabled,
    to improve performance
  - Tooltips are no longer very wide
  - Default config looks nicer
- New config options:
  - Executor: new plugin that displays the output of a command in the panel (issue #161)
  - New taskbar sort order options: least-recently-used (lru), most-recently-used (mru) (issue #532)
  - Place the primary monitor before all the other monitors (primary_monitor_first, issue #538)
  - taskbar_always_show_all_desktop_tasks (issue #279)
- Config options with changed behavior:
  - Mouse effects are enabled by default
- Fixes:
  - Battery changes visibility correctly (issue #531)
  - Fixed rendering corruption (issue #543)
  - Reverted the window flags back to the value in 0.11 to make sure the window manager detects that tint2 is a panel
    (affected kwin, bspwm; fixes issue #537, breaks issue #455)
  - Fixed a rare crash caused by the system tray code
  - The system tray now reorders icons correctly when the icon name changes and the sorting order is configured as
    ascending or descending (affected GTK icons, which sometimes set their name late after creating the icon)
  - Tint2conf no longer copies sample themes to ~/.config
- New optional dependencies:
  - libexecinfo on the *BSDs (only if the cmake flag ENABLE_BACKTRACE is set)

2015-11-12 0.12.3
- Enhancements:
  - Battery: Multiple batteries are now supported under Linux (issue #139;

    when the system is not able to read current data from sensors (issue #522;
    thanks to Sebastian Reichel)
  - Battery: Reacts to plug/unplug events (thanks to Sebastian Reichel)
  - tint2conf: Backgrounds now have a text label showing which panel component
    uses them, to make them easier to identify; the label is saved as a comment
    in the config file (issue #521)

2015-07-12 0.12
- Note: the changes listed here are based on the previous release tint2 0.11, however some distributions (e.g. Debian)
  offered packages using newer commits and/or patches; thus from the user's perspective some of these features are
  already present. They are marked with '(already released by distros)'.
- Major changes:
  - Panel:
  - Checks if a compositor is launched during the first 30 seconds after startup and if found, restarts the panel with
    transparency enabled.
  - Launcher:
    - The launcher is now considered stable
    - Enhancement: SVG icon support
    - Enhancement: more thorough search for icons
  - Configuration GUI: tint2conf
    - Experimental, testing/feedback needed
  - Icons (system tray, task buttons, launcher):
    - Changed rendering method to fix icon corruptions (please report any problems)
  - System tray:
    - Icon rendering is faster
    - Several kinds of graphical corruptions have been fixed
    - Added workaround for misbehaving applications leaving empty tray icons
  - Many bugfixes
- New config options (see https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2/wikis/Configure):
  - Panel:
    - panel_window_name
    - panel_items (already released by distros)
    - disable_transparency
  - Taskbar:
    - taskbar_distribute_size
    - taskbar_hide_different_monitor
    - taskbar_hide_inactive_tasks
    - taskbar_sort_order
    - taskbar_name (already released by distros)
    - task_align (already released by distros)
  - Launcher:
    - launcher* (already released by distros)
    - launcher_apps_dir (previously patched in by some distros)
    - startup_notifications
    - launcher_icon_theme_override
  - System tray:
    - systray_monitor
  - Freespace (already released by distros)
- Config options with changed behavior:
  - Panel:
    - panel_dock: previously, 'panel_dock = 1' was actually not placing the panel into the dock. This option now
      functions correctly. Due to the fact that OpenBox forcefully draws a border around dock windows, you might want to
      set it to zero (or change the border color/style to match tint2). If you set it to zero, make sure you do not have
      reserved space at the edge of the screen in the OpenBox config.
      Reason for change: issues 257, 394, 461, 465, 481.
    - panel_layer: previously, 'panel_layer = normal' was not functioning correctly. Now it does (it requires panel_dock = 0).
      Note that in this case some compositors will draw shadows of other windows behind tint2. This can be avoided in compton
      using the option shadow-exclude-reg = "x35+0-0" where 35 should be replaced with the size of the panel.
    - font_shadow: shadows are thicker and softer, and are now applied to all text elements, not just the taskbar.
      Reason for change: legibility improved for transparent panels.
  - Launcher:
    - launcher_item_app: now it expands leading ~ to the path to the user's home directory.
- Known issues:
  - tint2 might close unexpectedly and/or cause X to freeze on certain ATI graphics cards.
    Workaround: set 'disable_transparency = 1' in the config.
    Reference: https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2/issues/497
- Project hosting:
  - Migrated from https://code.google.com/p/tint2 to https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2 and switched from svn to git
- Bugfixes:
  - task switching from tint2 using the mouse wheel (mouse_scroll_up = prev_task and mouse_scroll_down = next_task) with
    multiple desktops and taskbar_mode = multi_desktop when hovering over the first/last window in the taskbar was broken;
    also when a window is set to appear on all desktops;
  - the launcher was not loading an icon if the icon theme was not providing it in a size close to the value of launcher_icon_size;
  - the launcher was not loading an icon if the extension was incorrect (e.g. file contents were PNG but the file name
    had extension SVG);
  - some launcher icons (PNG files saved with an indexed colormap and alpha mask) were sometimes rendered with white instead of
    transparency;
  - icons looked washed out when the panel was very transparent;
  - the panel border was rendered in the background of every systray icon; sometimes systray icons were rendered in the
    background of other icons;
  - a crash caused by a change that prevents Google Chrome (and possibly other misbehaving applications) from leaving a large
    number of empty icons in the system tray;
  - a crash caused by the system tray code on computers with ATI cards;
  - the panel window had a shadow;
  - some ATI drivers return an extra monitor with size zero which should be ignored when using panel_monitor = all;
  - the battery applet was sometimes working incorrectly with certain laptop models (the battery applet stopped updating after
    suspend with the battery unplugged);
  - crashed caused by incomplete or malformed config files;
  - with the fvwm window manager, the window title was sometimes not displayed correctly if it changed right after an
    application was started;
  - seconds were not updating in the clock;
  - tint2 hang triggered when an application started from the launcher was closed and startup notifications were enabled;
  - tint2 may fail to process X events for a few seconds when a new icon is added to the system tray;
  - the code that loads SVG icons was using a lot of memory;
  - fixed occasional race at startup in detecting screen resolution changes;
  - modified timer code to prevent some rare double-frees or duplicate timers.

  -> don't switch desktop when close a task of another desktop
  -> allow to drag and drop task between desktop
- change panel_position : you can now specify top or bottom.
  values : bottom left, bottom right, bottom center, top left, top right, top center
  keep compatibility with old tintrc files
- change Makefile :
  add $PREFIX and $DESTDIR
  install default config file in /etc/xdg/tint/tintrc
- on startup, tint copy $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/tint/tintrc in ~/.config/tint/tintrc
  so each user can customize tintrc
- fixed : name of task in fluxbox
- improve focus detection (TransientForHint)
- cleanup code : send_event

released tint-0.4

2008-05-12
- boolean option 'show_all_desktop'
  0 : tint panel show one taskbar (from current desktop)
  1 : tint panel show all taskbars (from all desktops)
      - clic on a task switch to the desktop
      - clic on a taskbar (if empty) switch to the desktop
- add layout for taskbar : panel -> taskbar -> task
- cleanup code : state 'active' in Task replaced by task_active in Panel
- hide some window : _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG, _NET_WM_STATE_MODAL
- change project to 'MIT licence'
  because Pål Staurland put 'MIT licence' in all file source

released tint-0.3

2008-05-10
- manage events : 'send to desktop' and 'send to all desktop'
- bug solved : 'close' action now send _NET_CLOSE_WINDOW
  so openoffice ask 'save document...' if needed
- cpu optimisation :
  -> don't redraw panel background on all events. just when desktop change.
  -> don't remove/add all tasks when switch between desktop. remove 'task_new_desktop()'.
- small bug on _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR corrected
- memory leak on g_build_filename
