// DATA ORGANISATION
//
// Areas in tint2 are similar to widgets in a GUI.
// All graphical objects (panel, taskbar, task, systray, clock, ...) inherit the abstract class Area.
// This class 'Area' stores data about the background, border, size, position, padding and the child areas.
// Inheritance is simulated by having an Area member as the first member of each object (thus &object == &area).
//
// tint2 uses multiple panels, one per monitor. Each panel has an area containing the children objects in a tree of
// areas. The level in the tree gives the z-order: child areas are always displayed on top of their parents.
//
//
// LAYOUT
//
// Sibling areas never overlap.
//
// The position of an Area (posx, posy) is relative to the window (i.e. absolute) and
// is computed based on a simple box model:
// * parent position + parent padding + sum of the sizes of the previous siblings and spacing
//
// The size of an Area is:
// * SIZE_BY_CONTENT objects:
//   * fixed and set by the Area
//   * childred are resized before the parent
//   * if a child size has changed then the parent is resized
// * SIZE_BY_LAYOUT objects:
//   * expandable and computed as the total size of the parent - padding -
//     the size of the fixed sized siblings - spacing and divided by the number of expandable siblings
//   * the parent is resized before the children
//
//
// RENDERING
//
// Redrawing an object (like the clock) could come from an 'external event' (date change)
// or from a 'layout event' (position change).
//
//
// WIDGET LIFECYCLE
//
// Each widget that occurs once per panel is defined as a struct (e.g. Clock) which is stored as a member of Panel.
// Widgets that can occur more than once should be stored as an array, still as a member of Panel.
//
// There is a special Panel instance called 'panel_config' which stores the config options and the state variables
// of the widgets (however some config options are stored as global variables by the widgets).
//
// Tint2 maintains an array of Panel instances, one for each monitor. These contain the actual Areas that are used to
// render the panels on screen, interact with user input etc.
// Each Panel is initialized as a raw copy (memcpy, see init_panel()) of panel_config.
//
// Normally, widgets should implement the following functions:
//
// * void default_widget();
//
//   Called before the config is read and panel_config/panels are created.
//   Afterwards, the config parsing code creates the widget/widget array in panel_config and
//   populates the configuration fields.
//   If the widget uses global variables to store config options or other state variables, they should be initialized
//   here (e.g. with zero, NULL etc).
//
// * void init_widget();
//
//   Called after the config is read and panel_config is populated, but before panels are created.
//   Initializes the state of the widget in panel_config.
//   If the widget uses global variables to store config options or other state variables which depend on the config
//   options but not on the panel instance, they should be initialized here.
//   panel_config.panel_items can be used to determine which backend items are enabled.
//
// * void init_widget_panel(void *panel);
//
//   Called after each on-screen panel is created, with a pointer to the panel.
//   Completes the initialization of the widget.
//   At this point the widget Area has not been added yet to the GUI tree, but it will be added right afterwards.
//
// * void cleanup_widget();
//
//   Called just before the panels are destroyed. Afterwards, tint2 exits or restarts and reads the config again.
//   Must releases all resources.
//   The widget itself should not be freed by this function, only its members or global variables that were set.
//   The widget is freed by the Area tree cleanup function (remove_area).
//
// * void draw_widget(void *obj, cairo_t *c);
//
//   Called on draw, obj = pointer to the widget instance from the panel that is redrawn.
//   The Area's _draw_foreground member must point to this function.
//
// * int resize_widget(void *obj);
//
//   Called on resize, obj = pointer to the front-end Execp item.
//   Returns 1 if the new size is different than the previous size.
//   The Area's _resize member must point to this function.
//
// * void widget_action(void *obj, int button);
//
//   Called on mouse click event.
//
// * void widget_on_change_layout(void *obj);
//
//   Implemented only to override the default layout algorithm for this widget.
//   For example, if this widget is a cell in a table, its position and size should be computed here.
//   The Area's _on_change_layout member must point to this function.
//
// * char* widget_get_tooltip_text(void *obj);
//
//   Returns a copy of the tooltip to be displayed for this widget.
//   The caller takes ownership of the pointer.
//   The Area's _get_tooltip_text member must point to this function.
